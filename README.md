# CH/OTP Test Task

This project is my solution to the "CH/OTP Test Task" problem defined in http://f.nn.lv/od/5c/8y/CH_OTP_Test_Task(1).pdf.

## Approach

I will try to approach the problem by implementing a total ordered queue of events as described in [Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System by Leslie Lamport](https://amturing.acm.org/p558-lamport.pdf) using logical clocks for partial ordering and `ProcessId` for totall ordering of processes.
